# Simple Food Tracker

This project is a simple food tracking app developed as part of the iOS module at the Syntax Institute. It is one of the apps created in the course and focuses on concepts such as **Lists**, **Alerts**, **Sheets**, **Forms**, **TabView**, **Basic Navigation**, and **Complex Navigation** in SwiftUI.

## About the App

The Simple Food Tracker allows users to log their daily meals, track nutritional information, and manage food entries. The app demonstrates how to use SwiftUI components like Lists, Alerts, Sheets, and Forms to create a user-friendly interface. It also covers navigation techniques, including basic and complex navigation flows.

## Features

- **Food Logging**: Add and manage food entries with details like name, calories, and category.
- **Nutrition Tracking**: View a summary of nutritional information for logged meals.
- **Alerts and Sheets**: Display alerts for important actions and use sheets for modal views.
- **TabView**: Organize different sections of the app (e.g., food log, settings) using a tab-based interface.
- **Navigation**: Implement both basic and complex navigation flows between views.

## Technologies and Concepts

- **Lists**: Display and manage collections of food entries.
- **Alerts**: Show confirmation dialogs or error messages.
- **Sheets**: Present modal views for adding or editing food entries.
- **Forms**: Create structured input forms for logging meals.
- **TabView**: Organize the app into multiple sections with a tab-based layout.
- **Basic Navigation**: Navigate between views using simple navigation links.
- **Complex Navigation**: Implement multi-level navigation flows and pass data between views.
